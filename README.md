This was a simple program I was asked to create. It was created as a challenge by another group. It calculates the amount owed to a babysitter depending on a family and time specified. I do need to look at simplifying it more to make it more flexibe and easier to maintain. There are a few spots I wish to update next when I get the time. Overall, the code is funcitonal. It is one of my first full attempts to create scratch Java code (beyond just maintenance).
